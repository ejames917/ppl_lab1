The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line? 


The use of pi at line 7 is bound at which line?

### (b) Consider the following Scala code.

The use of x at line 3 is bound at which line? 
The use of x at line 6 is bound at which line? 
The use of x at line 10 is bound at which line? 
The use of x at line 13 is bound at which line?

## Question 2: Typing
In the following, I have left off the return type of function g.The body of g is well-typed if we can come up with a valid return type. 
![alt text](https://github.com/ejames917/ppl_lab1/blob/master/images/p3.png)
Is the body of g well-typed?
If so, give the return type of g and explain how you determined this type.
